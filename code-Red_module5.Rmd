# Introduction

The purpose of this project was to determine whether human body temperature varies according to activity level. A study done by @wunder1974effect revealed that the body temperature of Ord's kangaroo rat was higher during times of activity than inactivity. In order to determine whether a similar relationship exists in humans, temperature was recorded in 4 subjects during 5 minutes of rest (sitting on a couch) and 5 minutes of activity (jumping jacks). The results were plotted in order to determine whether there is a significant difference in human body temperature when active versus inactive.
