# Introduction

The Lepidoptera are an order of insects compromised of nearly 160,000 species of butterflies and moths.They have both forewings and hindwings, each playing roles in functions such as flying and attracting mates.
Previous studies have found that if the hindwings of a moth or butterfly are removed, the insect can fly but its ability for linear and turning acceleration is greatly hindered [@jantzen2008hindwings]. Based on these findings, it can be concluded that Lepidoptera hindwing shape is due to selection for improved flight maneuverability. Further studies suggest that selection for forewing shape is determined by flight ability, while selection for hindwing shape is determined by several possibilities, such as neutral selection, sexual selection, and predator avoidance (Sourakov 2013, Barber et al. 2015, Willmott et al. 2017, Rubin et al. 2018, Chazot et al. 2016). While these studies show that Lepidoptera forewings and hindwings have evolved different functions, there is still much that is not known about their evolutionary history.The purpose of this study is to determine whether Lepidoptera forewings and hindwings vary in their evolutionary rates, if different lineages have evolved at significantly different rates, and if forewing and hindwing shapes are correlated.
This will be done by running a comparative phylogenetic analysis on the wing shape data of more than 200 species of Lepidoptera, using the phylogeny provided by @kawahara2019phylogenomics.

# Methods

Images of various species of Lepidoptera were digitized using FIJI.
Because the initial outlines included both forewing and hindwing outlines for each species, these were separated using file names.
Next, a Procrustes transformation wasperformed in order to translate, rotate, and scale the outlines for better analysis of their shape without factoring in arbitrary wing size.
Elliptical Fourier Analysis (EFA) was performed in order to describe wing shapes.
Principle Component Analysis (PCA) was then performed in order to minimize the number of variables explaining the variance in the data set.
The functions for these analyses are included in the R package "Momocs." PCA data was visualized to determine the distribution of morphoshape of the wings of the different species as well as the amount of variance described by different variables.

(insert relevant coding procedure here)

To prepare the comparative analysis on the PCA data the phylogenetic tree was loaded positioned upper left.
The file names of each species were also identified using the identifier data provided by Prof. Kenaley.
The PC data was added to the identified species data accordingly.
The phylogeny tree was modified to only include the species that were identified and had a PCA data.
From here, the forewing and hindwing PC1 and PC2 were separated in different variable under the Brownian Motion.
(insert relevant coding procedure here)

To determine the evolutionary rate, "RRphylo" package was used to determine the rate of evolution based on wing shape and from there, any statistically significant shift in shape evolution based on the Lepdioptera's clades were identified.
The rate of the significant evolutionary shift was identified along with the name of clades.
(insert relevant coding procedure here)

The phylogenetic independent contrast was performed on the PC datas to separate the original tip data independent of each other.
The PC values of forewing and hindwing data were then compared via linear model and analyzed to see if statistically significant value could be found.

\*note from James: this is obviously very rough methods section.
I'll try to refine it over the course of the next two days.

## Shape Analysis

<div style="text-align: left">
After visualizing the forewing and hindwing datas of the Lepidoptera species, the two wings were separated and scaled so that the wings were adjusted for their difference in size. This allowed for the contrast of wing shape only.

# Discussion
We first compared the rate of wing-shape evolution between forewings and hindwings. Evolutionary rates calculated from PC1 for forewings and hindwings differed by 35.56%, whereas evolutionary rates calculated from PC2 differed by 87.11%. There seems to be a significant shift in evolutionary rates between forewing and hindwing. 
Because forewing and hindwing were found to have different evolutionary rates, we examined shift in evolutionary rates of major lineages as it pertains to both hind- and forewing PC1. Results obtained from both agreed with each other, in that the clade Macroheterocera: Noctuoidea underwent a downward shift in wing-shape evolutionary rate. 
Next, to study fore- and hindwing shape correlation, we examined PC1 and PC2 transformed with phylogenetic information for both. PIC analysis on fore- and hindwing PC1 showed significant correlation (R-squared: 0.4476), whereas PIC analysis using PC2 found no significant correlation (R-squared: 0.00408).
